# st_ca (Special Topics in Computer Architecture)

Some stuff from projects I did a grad class called Special Topics in Computer Architecture.

It's generally related to stuff around caches.

"cache_working_set" is a project where we ran some apps and had to figure out the cache working set size.

"embargo" is a cache simulator I wrote in Python that was used to model a different cache insertion policies that were proposed in a white paper.
It was run against trace data collected with Pin to evaluate the efficacy of the different policies.
